# Development-only dependencies
# NOT needed for Vercel deployment
#
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# These packages are used for:
# - Local knowledge base ingestion (scripts/ingest_knowledge_base.py)
# - Pre-computing embeddings before deployment
#
# Note: These packages are too large for Vercel's 250MB limit and are
#       not needed in production since embeddings are pre-computed.
